# Responseive UI Test (Mobile & Web View Responsiveness)

This repository was created to assess the creation of a **mobile** and **web** view in Flutter based off a Figma Design.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. run ```flutter channel stable```
2. run ```flutter pub get```
3. run ```flutter run```

This repo is using **flutter 2.2.2**
## Points to Note

1. There is partial functionality for the mobile view such as **sort**, **filter**, and **search**, however there is none for the web and that is just pure design.
